					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
                    <p>I'm 19 and definitely on the introverted side. I find comfort in quieter settings and usually prefer smaller groups or one-on-one conversations over big social gatherings. I enjoy activities that let me think deeply, whether that's reading, working on personal projects, or just spending time with my thoughts. I appreciate meaningful conversations and tend to notice details that others might miss. I think this perspective makes me a good listener and someone who values genuine connections over surface-level interactions. Right now, I'm focused on finding interests that align with who I am and growing in my own way.</p>

                    <h3>Cyber Security Analyst</h3>
                    <p>
                       Deloitte| January - May
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                            <li><b>Reviewed Core Security Concepts:</b>Brushed up on essential cybersecurity concepts, like network security, firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection, and incident response, to discuss confidently during the interview.</li>
                            <li><b>Studied Current Threat Landscape:</b>Familiarized yourself with recent cyber threats, such as malware types, ransomware, and social engineering tactics, to showcase awareness of the latest security challenges.</li>
                            <h3>Impact of my Contribution</h3>
                            <li><b>Enhanced Security Posture:</b>

                                By identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening defenses, you help reduce the organization’s risk of cyberattacks, making it more resilient to threats. This builds trust with clients, customers, and partners who rely on the organization to keep their data secure.
                            </li>
                                <br>
                                <li><b>Reduced Incident Response Times:</b>
                                
                                Your proactive monitoring and quick response to potential threats could significantly reduce incident response times. Faster detection and response mean that security incidents have less impact, saving time, money, and resources.</li>
                            
                    </ul>

                    <h3> Software Developer </h3>

                            <li><b>Debugged and Troubleshot Issues: </b>I identified and fixed bugs, performance issues, and other errors. Debugging was a significant part of my role, allowing me to improve software stability and functionality.</li>
                            
                            <h3>Impact of my Contribution</h3>
                            <li><b>Higher Code Quality and Reliability:</b>By writing and reviewing code carefully, I was able to reduce bugs and enhance the reliability of the software. This not only made the product more stable and easier to maintain but also meant we could focus on new features rather than constantly fixing issues.</li>
                            <li><b>Improved Problem-Solving Skills:</b>Through consistent debugging and troubleshooting, I became more skilled at identifying and resolving issues quickly. This helped me minimize downtime and increased my productivity, as I could handle complex problems with greater confidence.</li>
                            <li><b>Scalable and Robust Architecture:</b>By planning the system architecture with scalability in mind, I was able to create software that could grow with user demands, handle large volumes of data, and integrate smoothly with other systems. This made future development easier and ensured the software could handle new requirements without major reworks.</li>
